# latex_templates

This is a repo to hold templates used in LaTeX by the Rehab robotics lab. 

If you are new to LaTeX, the [ShareLatex help](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn)
 is very good.

## Where to work in LaTeX?
You can work on your local computer, we recommend installing TexLive (you can find
guides online on how to install for your particular system). You will then need 
a text editor to work in. Visual Studio Code with LaTeX Workshop works very well. 
Another option is TeX Works or TeX Maker (one of which is installed with TexLive).
If you are working on a local machine, you may want to use git to track your
document and push up to a remote for safe keeping. 

You can also work in a browser. The recommended way to do this is to use ShareLatex.
ShareLatex allows very easy collaboration amongst various authors. 

Another option in the browser is OverLeaf. OverLeaf is not as collaboration friendly
but some people like the interface better. 

Coming soon is OverLeaf v2, which combines ShareLatex and Overleaf. You can use 
the beta now. 

## LaTeX is hard, why should I use it?
No it isn't you just don't get it yet, once you are used to it many things will
become easier.

The fundamental principles of LaTeX are in seperation of content and formatting
and automation. This means that you write what you want to say and include the
figures you want, but do not worry about the formatting. Then, once the content 
is correct, you can handle all of the formatting. Or you can go in the reverse
order. This means that many journals and conferences already have LaTeX style
classes, allowing you to just write and let them handle the style. You then know
that your paper is compliant with their style guide. Further, this allows you to 
change from one conference/journal to another by changing one line of your file. 
LaTeX also allows significant automation. It is after all a touring complete
language. So you can write your won packages/extensions to do your work for you
(although you will often find that a package already exists for what you want).

LaTeX is also very powerful for any sort of mathematical work you may need to do
equation formatting is easy and beautiful. It also allows the programmatic generation
of figures and charts. 

For general scientific writing, LaTeX makes handling in text citations and
bibliographies effortless and changing styles takes one line. It is also very 
easy to handle cross references in LaTeX, with numbering updating automatically. 

Finally, LaTeX is attractive, the math used in the LaTeX to get the fonts right
makes better looking text and the native support for vector graphics and internally
generated charts and tables are far more beautiful than anything else available 
to the average consumer. 

oh, and it's free. 

## How to use these templates
Simply copy the entire folder for the template you are interested in, rename the
.tex file to whatever you want, and start working. 

## I can't figure out how to do something, what should I do?
Ask the internet, then figure it out a bit, then ask the internet some more,
struggle some more, then ask someone in the lab for help (probably Michael
Sobrepera).
